# RedEssentials
RedEssentials focuses on having the widest variety of essential commands, while still being efficient and server friendly. RedEssentials is currently being developed, and I will gladly accept suggestions for commands.

### Commands

If arguments are surrounded in [] it means they are optional, however, if they are surrounded in <> they are required.
